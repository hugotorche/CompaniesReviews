# **ANALYZING AND PREDICTING EMPLOYEES SATISFACTION OF DANISH COMPANIES**
## Glassdoor and Indeed Reviews

### **Abstract**

The present paper analyzes Glassdoor and Indeed reviews for 5 of the biggest Dan- ish companies from various industries: Novo Nordisk, Carlsberg, Maersk, Lego, Danske Bank, and Pandora. The project involves Python to scrape reviews and create the datasets, while the Visual and Predictive analysis has been done using Knime and R. The aim is to look at reviews trends and distribution, as well as to try predicting compa- nies and ratings from reviews textual data. Therefore, the analysis includes visualization, textual preprocessing, and machine learning classification problems. The Visual Anal- ysis shows the general trends of companies reviews, and the differences in employees satisfaction between each company. It concludes with a better performance for Lego, Maersk, and Novo Nordisk. The Predictive Analysis shows that reviews text can predict companies but is inefficient on ratings. Further research must be done in that sense and with other companies.
